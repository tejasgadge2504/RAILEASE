# Flow of the RAILEASE Application
The flow of the RAILEASE application is divided into two main roles: User Tasks and Admin Tasks. The process ensures that the railway concession application is streamlined and efficient, reducing manual intervention and providing a seamless experience.

### User Tasks
**Start:** The process begins with the user initiating the system by registering themselves.

- User Registers:
-- The student provides the required personal and college-related details to create an account in the RAILEASE system.
Registration ensures that the user’s data is stored securely in the system for future processing.

- Accesses Application:
-- After admin approval, the user logs into the application with their credentials.
They gain access to the dashboard, where they can view their profile and apply for concessions.

- Applies Concession:
-- The user fills in the required details to apply for a railway concession.
This includes details like destination, purpose, and travel duration, which are essential for processing the concession.

- Collects Concession:
-- Once the application is approved by the admin, the user receives an email notification.
The student collects the concession pass, which is digitally generated or made available for pickup.
### Admin Tasks
- Admin Approves:
-- The admin reviews the registration requests submitted by the users.
-- Upon verification of the details provided, the admin approves or rejects the request.
-- An email is sent to the user confirming their registration status.
  
- Sends Confirmation Email:
-- Once the admin approves the user’s account, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the registered email ID.
This notification allows the user to log into the application and proceed further.

- Checks and Approves Concession:
-- After the user applies for a concession, the admin reviews the application.
The admin ensures that the application details are valid and meet the eligibility criteria for concession.
If everything is in order, the admin approves the concession request.

- Sends Approval Email:
-- Upon approval of the concession, an automated email is sent to the user informing them of the approval.
This email may also contain details or instructions for collecting the concession pass.
